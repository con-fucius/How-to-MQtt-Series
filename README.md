# How-to-MQTT-series
## Project Statement
MQTT is a messaging application that supports asynchronous communication between parties.MQTT broker is responsible for receiving all messages,filtering,decision making and sending messages to subscribed clients. For this project, we aimed at connecting our NodeMCU module to a MQTT broker and send messages to the ESP8266. We wanted to control the lighting of an LED.
